- 👋 Hi, I’m @danielvantsant

I want to fill this out a bit better as I go on.
My goal for now is to share the code that I've already done and make contributions to other projects.
Eventually I want to get a career coding but I need to define what I'd like to specialise in. 
I am excited in my endeavour to become a computer programmer.


//Will fill out later on:
- 👀 I’m interested in ...
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ...
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ...
- 📫 How to reach me ...
